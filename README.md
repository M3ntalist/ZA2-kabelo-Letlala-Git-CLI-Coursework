1. What is a benefit of using the Git CLI rather than a GUI?

<!-- Write your answer here -->
my answer is 
Benefits of CLI over GUI

Navigating through different icons makes the GUI slow. Thus CLI offers better speed as commands are directly given to the computer. So many professionals preferred CLI because of its speed and performance. Sometimes professionals are required to work in more than two languages.

2. What is the Git command to send your code to Github?

<!-- Write your answer here -->
The git push command is used to transfer or push the commit, which is made on a local branch in your computer to a remote repository like GitHub.

3. What does the -m in a Git commit command mean or do?

<!-- Write your answer here -->
The most common option used with git commit is the -m option. The -m stands for message. When calling git commit , it is required to include a message. The message should be a short description of the changes being committed.

4. What is the Git command for making a commit?

<!-- Write your answer here -->
To add a Git commit message to your commit, you will use the git commit command followed by the -m flag and then your message in quotes. Adding a Git commit message should look something like this: git commit -m “Add an anchor for the trial end section.”

5. What is the Git command to select the files you want to add to a commit?

<!-- Write your answer here -->
Enter git add --all at the command line prompt in your local project directory to add the files or changes to the repository.

6. What is the Git command to see changes you have waiting to be committed?

<!-- Write your answer here -->


Run git branch --set-upstream master origin/<branch> to setup upstream if you are inclined to use this command to see commits that are staged. This will compare with default branch in origin, not current remote branch.

7. What is the Git command to get changes from Github onto your computer?

<!-- Write your answer here -->
Use git fetch to retrieve new work done by other people. Fetching from a repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into your own branches. Otherwise, you can always add a new remote and then fetch.
